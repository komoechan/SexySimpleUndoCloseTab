# SexySimpleUndoCloseTab
Manage your browser history and recently closed tabs

This is a product similar to SimpleUndoClose and Sexy Undo Close Tab. Since these products have not been updated for several years and do not support the latest Chrome manifest V3 protocol, I created this one. To pay tribute to the pioneers, I chose this name.

It should be noted that I am not a programmer. Every line of code in this extension was completed by Github Copilot. I have tried my best to test and ensure that the current functions are usable. However, given the current limitations of AI capabilities, it may be difficult to expand more features in the short term.

The biggest difference between this product and previous Undo Close Tab products is that it allows you to view and search your browsing history simultaneously. This is designed to solve the scenario where it is difficult to quickly find the webpage you were on before jumping to another tab and closing it.

Since all the code is generated by AI, I can't guarantee that the architecture is clean and efficient. In fact, even though I don't know how to code, I can still see that some parts of the code are clearly not the best way to do thingsâ€”like the multi-language section. If you like this product and want to help make it better, or if you want to write a better version yourself, feel free to use the code.

Known issues:
Lack of tooltips.
Lack of a more user-friendly one-click cleanup.
Lack of more configurable options.
